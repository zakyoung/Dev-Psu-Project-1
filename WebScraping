Project: For this project the goal is to scrape the information data box from the penn state wiki page
and outputing the data as a csv where the header is the first value and the data is the second value

Code:
In line 8: striping new Line character and we use the list slice of [1:20] becuase we want from the Motto to the Website to be collected

In lines 21-27 we are creating a list of the resulting table data values while stripping away the numbers
refercing the sources. Example [1] representing data source 1

In line 30: Data is zipped into a list where each item is a tuple with the data/item pair

In line 36: Finally the info is writen to a csv labeled output
